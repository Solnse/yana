<h1>Yana's Story</h1>
<p>Yana Lepeikina was born june 11th, 2005 to a very loving family in the Russian city of Tomsk. When she was 1 month old, doctors said that she was born with congenital heart disease (incomplete form AB-communication). On the 12th of May 2006, American doctors performed surgery on Yana's heart in Tomsk; the surgery was succesful. Yana stayed alive, but started to be sick all the time... often flu and coughing. In 2007, doctors diagnosed Yana's asthma and said that her family should move to better climate; a hotter city (Tomsk is very cold). For this reason, Yana's family moved to Saratov.</p>
<p>In Saratov, Yana started to feel better and better, her family relaxed thinking that all will be great now. 3 years Yana lived a normal life and she went to her new, local cardiologyst that said that Yana is healthy. In july 2011, Yana's family went to Tomsk to visit relatives and while they were there, they went to the cardio clinic and Yana had a Heart ultra sound examination. Doctors were shocked. The pressure in her lung veins was really high and they were surprized how the child was still alive with such high pressure. Yana was prescribed to take the medicine named Viagra, that make the lung viens wider (vasodilation). </p>
<p>Yana's family went back to Saratov. At the end of January, Yana was invited to Tomsk again for more tests and she had to be intubated. After surgery Yana woke up, her first question what was with her heart and will she stay alive. Olesya, her mother said yes. But doctors said no. After all the tests were done, Yana's doctors said to Olesya that they need to make another child becouse Yana will die soon. Olesya was crushed. She didnt know what to do. Yana understood everything and constantly asked, what will happen to her and why is Olesya crying all the time. Doctors just said that Viagra didnt help, and sent Yana and Olesya back to Saratov. </p>
<p>At the end of February, Tomsk cardio-centre called to Olesya and said that American doctors that did surgery in 2006 came to Tomsk and want to see Yana. Yana's family immediately packed their bags and jumped on the train to see the doctors again. After her consultation, the doctors said that the only thing that will help Yana live is a left lung resection. They gave Yana one year to do this. After Yana's family returned to Saratov again, Olesya found a clinic in Germany on the internet and wrote them a letter (in Russia this kind of operation cant be done). The German clinic agreed to perform the operation but gave the price of 24,970 EUR(~$32,481). </p>
<p>Yana's Russian family has already exhausted all their resources to find some solution to Yana's condition. To earn this amount of money, they would need to work for 3 years, but doctors only gave 1 year to Yana. So Olesya decided to ask people for help, her last chance. Yana goes to 1 class in school in Saratov; she is very intelligent. She likes to paint and play piano. She attends music school. Yana is a very smiley and kind girl, she loves this life a lot. She asks her mother very often now if she will be living: of course Olesya says that she will.  ...any amount of money will be helpful, any help will be appreciated, soon Yana will have her 7th birthday and we all hope that it will not be her last birthday.</p>

<h2>A plea from a sick girl's mother...</h2>
<p>Olesya writing .... <br /><br />

My name is Olesya Lepeykina. My daughter Jana Lepeykinoy requires removal of the proportion of the left lung. I'll tell you a little about her life: John was born June 11, 2005. In a month my daughter was diagnosed with congenital heart disease, the full form of AB Communications. In 2006, May 12 was the correction of vice by American surgeons (there are extracts). All this time my family lived in the city of Tomsk. The Yankees have had a disability, we have received the necessary medical supplies. Jan is often hurt. Constant colds, stenosis, and cough. In 2007, asthma placed in the initial form. On the recommendation of the doctors have decided to change the climate, so we ended up in Saratov. 3 years we were registered at the Regional Children's Hospital cardiologist, who over the years say that the baby is healthy. Janka really feel good about themselves. We have forgotten what is asthma and cough. Once a year we do ultrasound findings in the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension was prescribed 2-3 degrees. But no one never said that we need at least a treatment or examination. Disability is natural has been removed. In July 2011 we went on vacation to his hometown. In Tomsk, Jan did ultrasound in Cardiology. The pressure in the pulmonary veins was 63 mm p / p. Doctors just do not fall into a swoon. They were strange as a child lived with the pressure in the lungs. Prescribed to us, "Viagra", it dilates blood vessels in the lungs. From July to February We have taken this drug. We bought it at his own expense. In December, drew up a disability. In late January we were invited to angiography in the Tomsk Cardiology. We went to Jana go to the hospital. A survey was conducted. I attached the results of his below.   My daughter woke up after anesthesia asked: And I have already sensing that? I have a heart all right? I of course replied that everything is fine, but at that moment I knew that she had lung problems. After angiography, we had another bunch of surveys, and said that we need to have a second child-that potamu   Janka will not live. I spilled a bucket of tears. But for the second child, I can not decide, and we can not have children with her ​​husband. We have a genetic incompatibility.   After sensing that we were told that we were drinking Viagra does not help us.   We were sent home.   In late February, we received a call from Tomsk, and was invited to a consultation Americans that we were doing the operation in 2006. And again, we boarded a train. Two days on the road and we are in the hospital. After consulting the Americans told us   that we deliver only the removal of the proportion of the left lung and pulmonary veins.   Daly a year then that would be all done. And we were again sent home. I found on the Internet clinic Germany and Israel. On   Now the two leading correspondence.   I guess what amount will appear   in the long run. Our family will not pull a lot of money. Her husband works a storekeeper in stock, I'm in the same warehouse operator.   Janka goes to first grade. A good student. Attend music school. It likes to sing and play piano.   In the summer we go to Grandma's to the country, helping her. Ian is very friendly and responsive girl. She really wants to live. She hears that the doctors were telling me about her diagnosis. Very often asks me a question whether it will live ............. I say it would be ............   That's how I live in expectation of a miracle. What do I do not know. Proshu   Your help.</p>
