				Yana is a beautiful, cheerful, innocent girl who deserves a chance at a happy life. 
				Since she was 1 month old, she has been fighting for her life with a congenital heart
				defect. Doctors performed a surgery, but now she is in need of another life-saving 
				miracle.
				<br /><br />
            	After exhausting all possible solutions to help Yana, we are creating this website 
            	to reach out to the public in hopes that we can find the help she so desperately needs. 
            	Please look over the pages, read about Yana's story, look at some of her favorite pictures, 
            	and find it in your heart to help Yana in some small way. Your help can save her life, 
            	and let an amazing girl continue her happy journey through this life.
            	<br /><br />
            	What Yana needs now most of all is help paying for her life-saving surgery. If you are unable to donate,
            	perhaps you will find some way to brighten her days. Send her a letter (it's always exciting),
            	or send her a small gift. Whatever way you can help, small or big will bring such joy to her.
            	Thank you for your attention, and best thoughts and wishes to you from Yana herself.
