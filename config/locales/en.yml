      story:
        block_1: "Yana Lepeikina was born june 11th, 2005 to a very loving family in the Russian city of Tomsk.
                  When she was 1 month old, doctors said that she was born with congenital heart disease (incomplete
                  form AB-communication). On the 12th of May 2006, American doctors performed surgery on Yana\'s heart 
                  in Tomsk; the surgery was succesful. Yana stayed alive, but started to be sick all the time... 
                  often flu and coughing. In 2007, doctors diagnosed Yana\'s asthma and said that her family should 
                  move to better climate; a hotter city (Tomsk is very cold). For this reason, Yana\'s family moved to Saratov."
        block_2: "In Saratov, Yana started to feel better and better, her family relaxed thinking that all will be great now. 
                  3 years Yana lived a normal life and she went to her new, local cardiologyst that said that Yana is healthy. 
                  In july 2011, Yana\'s family went to Tomsk to visit relatives and while they were there, they went to the 
                  cardio clinic and Yana had a Heart ultra sound examination. Doctors were shocked. The pressure in her lung 
                  veins was really high and they were surprized how the child was still alive with such high pressure. 
                  Yana was prescribed to take the medicine named Viagra, that makes the lung viens wider (vasodilation)."
        block_3: "Yana\'s family went back to Saratov. At the end of January, Yana was invited to Tomsk again for more tests and 
                  she had to be intubated. After surgery Yana woke up, her first question what was with her heart and will she 
                  stay alive. Olesya, her mother said yes. But doctors said no. After all the tests were done, Yana\'s doctors 
                  said to Olesya that they need to make another child becouse Yana will die soon. Olesya was crushed. She didnt 
                  know what to do. Yana understood everything and constantly asked, what will happen to her and why is Olesya 
                  crying all the time. Doctors just said that Viagra didnt help, and sent Yana and Olesya back to Saratov."
        block_4: "At the end of February, Tomsk cardio-centre called to Olesya and said that American doctors that did surgery in 
                  2006 came to Tomsk and want to see Yana. Yana\'s family immediately packed their bags and jumped on the train 
                  to see the doctors again. After her consultation, the doctors said that the only thing that will help Yana live 
                  is a left lung resection. They gave Yana one year to do this. After Yana\'s family returned to Saratov again, 
                  Olesya found a clinic in Germany on the internet and wrote them a letter (in Russia this kind of operation can\'t 
                  be done). The German clinic agreed to perform the operation but gave the price of 24,970 EUR(~$32,481)."
        block_5: "Yana\'s Russian family has already exhausted all their resources to find some solution to Yana\'s condition. To 
                  earn this amount of money, they would need to work for 3 years, but doctors only gave 1 year to Yana. So Olesya 
                  decided to ask people for help, her last chance. Yana goes to 1 class in school in Saratov; she is very intelligent. 
                  She likes to paint and play piano. She attends music school. Yana is a very smiley and kind girl, she loves this 
                  life a lot. She asks her mother very often now if she will be living; of course Olesya says that she will. Any 
                  amount of money will be helpful, any help will be appreciated, soon Yana will have her 7th birthday and we all hope 
                  that it will not be her last birthday."

        o_block: 		"My name is Olesya Lepeykina. My daughter Jana Lepeykinoy requires removal of the proportion of the left lung. 
                         I\'ll tell you a little about her life: Jana was born June 11, 2005. In a month my daughter was diagnosed with 
                         congenital heart disease, the full form of AB Communications. In 2006, May 12 was the correction of vice by 
                         American surgeons (there are extracts). All this time my family lived in the city of Tomsk. The Yankees have 
                         had a disability, we have received the necessary medical supplies. Jana is often hurt. Constant colds, stenosis, 
                         and cough. In 2007, asthma placed in the initial form. On the recommendation of the doctors have decided to 
                         change the climate, so we ended up in Saratov. 3 years we were registered at the Regional Children\'s Hospital 
                         cardiologist, who over the years say that the baby is healthy. Janka really feel good about themselves. We have 
                         forgotten what is asthma and cough. Once a year we do ultrasound findings in the diagnosis of pulmonary 
                         hypertension was prescribed 2-3 degrees. But no one never said that we need at least a treatment or examination. 
                         Disability is natural has been removed. In July 2011 we went on vacation to his hometown. In Tomsk, Jan did 
                         ultrasound in Cardiology. The pressure in the pulmonary veins was 63 mm p / p. Doctors just do not fall into a 
                         swoon. They were strange as a child lived with the pressure in the lungs. Prescribed to us, \"Viagra\", it dilates 
                         blood vessels in the lungs. From July to February We have taken this drug. We bought it at his own expense. In 
                         December, drew up a disability. In late January we were invited to angiography in the Tomsk Cardiology. We went to 
                         Jana go to the hospital. A survey was conducted. I attached the results of his below.   My daughter woke up after 
                         anesthesia asked: And I have already sensing that? I have a heart all right? I of course replied that everything 
                         is fine, but at that moment I knew that she had lung problems. After angiography, we had another bunch of surveys, 
                         and said that we need to have a second child-that potamu   Janka will not live. I spilled a bucket of tears. But 
                         for the second child, I can not decide, and we can not have children with her ​​husband. We have a genetic 
                         incompatibility.   After sensing that we were told that we were drinking Viagra does not help us.   We were sent 
                         home.   In late February, we received a call from Tomsk, and was invited to a consultation Americans that we were 
                         doing the operation in 2006. And again, we boarded a train. Two days on the road and we are in the hospital. 
                         After consulting the Americans told us that we deliver only the removal of the proportion of the left lung and 
                         pulmonary veins. Daly a year then that would be all done. And we were again sent home. I found on the Internet 
                         clinic Germany and Israel. On Now the two leading correspondence. I guess what amount will appear in the long run. 
                         Our family will not pull a lot of money. Her husband works a storekeeper in stock, I\'m in the same warehouse 
                         operator. Janka goes to first grade. A good student. Attend music school. It likes to sing and play piano.   
                         In the summer we go to Grandma\'s to the country, helping her. Jana is very friendly and responsive girl. She 
                         really wants to live. She hears that the doctors were telling me about her diagnosis. Very often asks me a question 
                         whether it will live ............. I say it would be ............   That\'s how I live in expectation of a miracle. 
                         What do I do not know. Proshu Your help."
